YASCU = Yet Another Screen Capture Utility

In response to a code challenge, I started this project. details: http://zaidpirwani.com/892/code-challenge-un-charterd-gui-land/

This repository will serve as a test-bench for me to test C# code, I am fairly good with programming, but still this easy task is looking out to be quite difficult. I will try to get one thing done each day and commit here every 2/3 days.

Planned Features [ESSENTIALS]:
--Notification Area Icon
--Global Hotkey to start REGION Capture
--Save Captured as PNG File
--Put captured image on Clipboard to paste in other apps
