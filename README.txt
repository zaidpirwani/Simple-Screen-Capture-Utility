SSCU = Simple Screen Capture Utility
[changed name from YASCU = Yet Another Screen Capture Utility due to trademark infringement issues... :)]

In response to a code challenge, I started this project.

http://zaidpirwani.com/928/sscu-simple-screen-capture-utility-v-1-0-beta/

This repository will serve as a test-bench for me to test C# code, I am fairly good with programming, but still this easy task is looking out to be quite difficult. I will try to get one thing done each day and commit here every 2/3 days.

Planned Features [ESSENTIALS]:
--Notification Area Icon
--Global Hotkey to start REGION Capture
--Save Captured as PNG File
--Put captured image on Clipboard to paste in other apps
